Some notes:
-Copy cut paste is implemented (found in toolbar or keyboard shortcuts:
x for cut, c for copy, v for paste)
-Default resolution is 1600x1200, resizeable from 640x540 to 1920x1440
-Regardless of what tool is selected, clicking blank part of the canvas or pressing ESC clears current color/line settings (deselection)
-A DropShadow indicates the currently selected shape
-Pasted shapes always at appear at a fixed position (as it was not specified in assignment)
-If shape is currently selected and paste is called, it will delete the selected shape (just like text were highlighted
and paste was called, as answered on Piazza)
