Programmed on a Windows machine, used versions specified
in setup:
Git Client 2.24
OpenJDK 11.0.8
Gradle 6.6

Notes:
- All assignment specs have been included, did not allow
resizing of window since assignment states we have to 
program in a game window of 1280x800
- If fixed fruit spawns on snake at the beginning of a level,
it is replaced at a random position not occupied by fruit
or the snake's body and does not count towards the score/fruit
eaten
- All keys have been incorporated, use p to pause, r to
go to start screen, 1,2,3 for levels, and q to quit and
display scores
- You cannot press 2 or 3 to switch to levels when on the
start sceen or end screen, I could have included this, but
it did not make sense to me as new games should start
from level 1 (can only press 2 or 3 to switch when on a level)
