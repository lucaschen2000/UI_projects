Notes:
If one stroke is used without removing finger when erasing different lines, these are counted as 
	separate instances for the purposes of undo/redo
As mentioned in Piazza (https://piazza.com/class/ke4dr83lduz26g?cid=690), I used
	left and right buttons at the buttom for page navigation
Ended up removing pan and zoom because I couldn't get it working properly
